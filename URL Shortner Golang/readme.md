## URL Shortner

### What Is URL Shortening?<br>
URL shortening is a technique on the internet in which a <b>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</b> may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL.<br>
e.g.URL <i>example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/</i> can be shortened to <i>example.com/Foo</i>
