## URL Shortner

### What Is URL Shortening?<br>
URL shortening is a technique on the internet in which a <b>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</b> may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL.<br>
For example: The URL: <b><i>example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/</i></b>can be shortened to <b><i>example.com/Foo</i></b>
Other uses of URL shortening are to "beautify" a link, track clicks, or disguise the underlying address. Although disguising of the underlying address may be desired for legitimate business or personal reasons, it is open to abuse.<br>
